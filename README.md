## About

The StudentScore Management application, released in 2023 by EduTech Solutions, is designed to support educators in efficiently managing student grade data. Our primary motivation in developing this application is to enhance academic management and simplify the administration of student grades. StudentScore Management streamlines the process of recapitulating and managing grade data by offering four excellent features that improve operational efficiency. These features include:

1. **Read data**, The StudentScore Management application displays student grade data, which can be viewed in its entirety or filtered by gender.
2. **Add data**, The StudentScore Management application can add new student grade data.
3. **Update data**, The StudentScore Management application can updating student grade data either by grade or by name.
4. **Delete data**, The StudentScore Management application provides high mobility to remove items that you do not need.

With these features, educators can easily monitor and manage students' academic progress, ensure data accuracy and timeliness, and increase productivity in managing student grade data
